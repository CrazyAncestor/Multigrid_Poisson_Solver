3. cd bin
4. sh clean.sh
5. ./main

Simulation Parameters:
Please edit include/simulation_option.h


Add new simulation:
1. goto "include/macro.h" define a new problem number(e.g. #define PROB_TEST)
2. goto "initialize.cpp" and "initialize.h" add a new initialize funciton for your problem.
3. goto "include/initialize.h" add the prototype for your function.
4. goto "include/simulation_option.h" define PROB_NUM to be your PROB_TEST
